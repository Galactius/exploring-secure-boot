## Day 1 - 5/30/2023 

Today is my first working day on this project, I started working at 10:30AM, then stopped at 3:30PM. 

I started today by reviewing the project requirements as described in the schedule provided by Dr. Nwafor. I then setup a Trello board with this information and shared it to Dr. Nwafor. I also started picking out which papers I wanted to start reading. I chose 5 papers and downloaded them to my 2023 research onedrive folder and saved their citation links in Semantic Scholar. Next, I setup my development environment by downloading VS Code and Obsidian and configuring them as needed. I ended the day by setting up a github repo with a documentation site hosted through readthedocs. However, the deployment of the docs site had some issues (a deprecated dependency issue I've seen and fixed before). After a bit more time, I was able to fix the issues with the docs site, which is now available at exploring-secure-boot.readthedocs.io. Remaining work today will be spent continuing to configure the docs site and reading papers.

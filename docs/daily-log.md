# Daily Research Journal

## Day 1 - 5/30/2023 

Today is my first working day on this project, I started working at 10:30AM, then stopped at 3:30PM. 

I started today by reviewing the project requirements as described in the schedule provided by Dr. Nwafor. I then setup a Trello board with this information and shared it to Dr. Nwafor. I also started picking out which papers I wanted to start reading. I chose 5 papers and downloaded them to my 2023 research onedrive folder and saved their citation links in Semantic Scholar. Next, I setup my development environment by downloading VS Code and Obsidian and configuring them as needed. I ended the day by setting up a github repo with a documentation site hosted through readthedocs. However, the deployment of the docs site had some issues (a deprecated dependency issue I've seen and fixed before). After a bit more time, I was able to fix the issues with the docs site, which is now available at exploring-secure-boot.readthedocs.io. Remaining work today will be spent continuing to configure the docs site and reading papers. 

## Day 2 - 5/31/2023

Today I started working at 11:00AM and stopped at 4:00PM. 

I started the day by finishing up fixing the issues with the documentation site, which took some time as I had to reset the site on the host (which is readthedocs for this project). After fixing the website and ensuring that my VS Code configuration was working properly, I continued to read papers starting with "A Survey of Secure Boot Schemes for Embedded Devices", as well as some online articles describing how to create a custom ESP32 breakout board. I'm not sure that we will end up needing to create a custom PCB unless we decide to implement some hardware-based secure boot method (which I would need to do much more research on as I have never created a custom PCB). I picked an ESP32 to start looking into just because I have my personal ESP32 microcontroller that I can reference if needed later. My personal notes for each paper I read are not pushed to the github as of now.
